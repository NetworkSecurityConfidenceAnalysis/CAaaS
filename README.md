<b>Confidence Analysis as a Service</b>

* This site is referenced in several papers involving our SDN Confidence Analysis research.  Due to anonymity requirements for some conferences, this reference material has been moved to a private server that is currently under construction.

This project, <b>Confidence Analysis as a Service (CAaaS)</b>, is a northbound SDN application and several southbound plugins that provide
extended visibility into SDN and hybrid networks.  The application provides a security confidence analysis of a specific network path or segment.  This security confidence analysis is quantified and represented as a weighted score value provided by a RESTful Service.

If you have any questions or would like access to a private project, feel free to contact <b>Scott Melton at smelton2 <at) uccs (dot> edu</b>.
